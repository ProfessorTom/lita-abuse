# lita-abuse

This plugin is extremely abusive. Only use this if users do not mind being
offended! This is based in the excellent work of Ben Lovell and his abuse Hubot
and abuse as a service platform: https://github.com/benlovell/abuse/. Take
a look at that for examples of the abuse you might receive.

```
